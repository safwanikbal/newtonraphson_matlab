# Newton–Raphson Method (MATLAB)

This repository contains a simple MATLAB implementation of the Newton–Raphson method for finding the root of a nonlinear equation.

## Description
The script uses an initial guess and iteratively updates the solution using the function and its derivative until the specified tolerance is reached or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

## Features
- Anonymous function inputs
- Error tracking per iteration
- Iteration limit and basic error handling
- Displays final root, error, and number of iterations
- 
## Language
MATLAB
